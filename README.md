# Datacamp's Professional Data Scientist Certification Project

This repo contains the case study presented to fulfill Datacamp's Professional Data Scientist Certification Project. Upon completion, a certificate was issued, that can be consulted in [here](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DS0017398278458)

The case study was split into two parts:

1. [Technical report](https://github.com/AndresNaza/Datacamp-Professional-Data-Scientist-Certification-Project/tree/main/Technical%20report)

In the case of the technical report, the audience was a data science manager. It can be considered that the work was being presented to show how the task has been approached, why certain actions were taken, and how the work helps to solve the problem defined.

2. [Non-technical presentation](https://github.com/AndresNaza/Datacamp-Professional-Data-Scientist-Certification-Project/tree/main/Non-technical%20presentation)

The final stage was to adapt the information towards a non-technical audience. It is a common requirement for data scientists to have to present their work to others who have no background in data science. These audiences are interested in why the work was done and what the outcome was, typically not how it was done.
